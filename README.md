This was for a Hackathon spring 2025 about water issues.
We created a drought detector for utah. 
This is was in the form of MVC where we used c# for the view and controllers, and python for the model.
There is an api to access the python model from our controllers in c#. We used docker to run this with a duel docker set up on one device. 

24 hours worth of time for the entire project; the web app, and machine learning model was not even the entire project so this is a very rushed project. There is little commentation and lots of the pushes to git were nonsensical.
I also struggled to understand why certain files kept pushing to git even when I tried to put them in the gitIgnore. 

However many problems there are we made a product and presented at the hackathon. 

(Also one more note that the values passed in to the model must be realistic to get an output as then model doesnt like to play with abusrd values and will most likely fail to return a risk level.)
